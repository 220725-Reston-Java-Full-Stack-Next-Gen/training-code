# Project 2

With Project 1 out of the way, it's time to work as a part of a larger group to build a full-stack application leveraging Spring for the application server and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for UI! The concept and functionality for this application will be up to you are your teammates! More information on the requirements for this project are found below.

## Suggested topics for Project:
- ECommerce website
- Social media website
- A user forum for common fans
- Online banking application

## High-Level Requirements

Application must leverage the full stack: 
- PostgreSQL for persistence 
- API built with Java 8 and Spring 5
- UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Testing built using JUnit & Mockito

Technology framework requirements: 
- Java API will leverage the Spring Framework 
- Java API will use Spring Data JPA to communicate with the DB
- Java API will be RESTful (though HttpSession will be permitted)
- Java API will be unit tested using JUnit and Mockito

Other requirements: 
- Application will demonstrate at least ten individual user stories 
- Application will leverage at least one external API 
- Application's own data model must be sufficiently complex (i.e. >2 tables) 
- SQL DB will be deployed to the cloud using AWS RDS
- Java API will have >=80% test coverage for service layer (confirmed by Sonarcloud quality gate analysis)
- Java API will leverage Spring's MockMvc for integration/e2e tests of controller endpoints


Suggested bonus goals:
- Create your UI application using Angular
- Angular UI will have >= 60% test (line) coverage for all custom components (confirmed by Jasmine/Karma coverage report)
- Secure your Java API using JWTs/HTTP Cookies for authenicating users
- Complete a CI/CD pipeline using AWS web services (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, Elastic Beanstalk, and S3)

## Other Thoughts

The project concepts must be approved by the trainer. Remember to keep user stories clear and unambiguous. Keep in mind that you only have 2.5 weeks to work on this project so make your MVP something attainable. In addition to your project proposal, teams should also structure themselves with one team leader and a person or persons who fulfill the role of Gitflow manager.  Lastly, avoid the temptation to divide work into "API" and "UI", all associates must implement logic on both sides of the stack! 

## Repositories

It is recommended that you create two repositories under someone's personal account. One repository can host the API, and the other repository can host the repo for the UI.

## Presentations

Presentations will occur on the morning of Friday, September 23rd, 2022. All team members must have a speaking role in the presentation of the application, and a PowerPoint slideshow must accompany your presentation.
