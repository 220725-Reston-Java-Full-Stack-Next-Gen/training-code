    <h1>First heading</h1>
    <h2>Second heading</h2>
    <h3>Third heading</h3>
    <h4>Fourth heading</h4>
    <h5>Fifth heading</h5>
    <h6>Sixth heading</h6>

    <!-- In HTML5, semantic tags were introduced to ease readability for screenreaders. EX. heading, section, caption, main, etc. -->
    <!-- The heading tag is a special type of div tag -->
    <heading>
        <p>This is my first HTML document.</p>
    </heading>

    <div>
        <p>This is my second paragraph.</p>

    <!-- HTML tags can also be called HTML elements. An element holds the content. -->
    <!-- HTML elements can also have attributes. An attribute is used to describe the characterstic of an HTML element in detail.
    Attributes can be found in the start tag of an HTML element. 

    this is inline styling with CSS
    <p id="my-p" class="p-masters just-cuz" style="color: blue;">Some content</p>-->
    <p id="my-p" class="p-masters just-cuz">Some content</p>
    <p id="my-p">Another</p>

    <!-- The key attributes that you guys will be using are: id and class. These attributes serve as identifiers for your HTML element -->
    <!-- id = most specific identifier bc each element can have only one ID -->
    <!-- class = less specific identifier attribute = can use multiple classes for any given HTML element -->

    <!-- Block vs inline elements -->
    <!-- Block level elements would create a new line of content, stacking on top of one another. Ex. div-->
    <!-- Inline level elements would stay within the flow of whats surround them, never travelling the next new line without a <br> -->
    <div>
        <!-- Span tags are good examples of inline elements -->
        <span>My little label for my name is: </span><!--<br> this will make it move to the next line-->
        <span>Azhya Alease Knox</span>
    </div>

    <!-- Self-closing tags are tags that do not have an end tag. Ex. br, img, input (sometimes), hr -->
