/*
    What is THIS?
    In JS, the 'this' keyword refers to the object that it belongs to.
    - By itself, this refers to the global object
    - In a function, this still refers the global object
    - In a method (in JS, a method is a function that belongs to an object), this refers to the owner object
    - In strict mode (Strict mode makes some bad coding practices return errors by placing your JS code in a more restricted variant of itself), this (in a function) returns undefined
