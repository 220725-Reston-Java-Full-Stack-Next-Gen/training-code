/*
    JS classes were introduced in ES6 & give us the ability to implement OOP in JS. 
    
    So we can make constructors and functions that can be used in other parts of our JS code
    
    Why use JS classes?
        - offer an improved means for creating object templates
        - replace the previous means of using constructor functions for object
        - makes our code more manageable and reusable in other parts of our JS code
