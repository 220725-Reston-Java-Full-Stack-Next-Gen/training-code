# HTTP Activity

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.

Today, we will be exploring HTTP requests and response in depth by making requests to a popular, public API known as the PokeAPI.

## Instructions
1. Open Postman on your computer.

2. Make the following requests using the Postman interface to answer the following questions:
    - [ ] https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto
        1. From the JSON data, what is Ditto's primary type?
        2. From the response headers, what is the value of the Content-Type?
    - [ ] https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/3
        1. What was the HTTP status code for this request's response?
        2. In which part of the request does the JSON reside in?
    - [ ] https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/sturdy
        1. Based on this request and the previous ones, which HTTP verb is this request's action?
        2. What is the URI for this request (Hint: it is already a part of the URL)?

*You will need to enter the above URLs into Postman. Make notes of what your trainer does to make a Postman request.*
