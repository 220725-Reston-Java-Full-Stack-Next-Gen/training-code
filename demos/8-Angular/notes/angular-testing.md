# Introduction to Jasmine & Karma
- Testing any UI framework like Angular requires the practice of BDD (behavior driven development)
    - BDD is a subset of TDD; it is an Agile software development methodology in which an application is documented and designed around the behavior a user EXPECTS to experience when interacting with the application.
- Where does Jasmine and Karma fit in with BDD in Angular?
    - Jasmine (is the specification/syntax used in BDD in Angular)
        - is a testing framework where we call different methods and classes using a human-readable syntax
    - Karma (is the implementator of BDD in Angular)
        - Karma is a task runner
        - is the mechanism that runs our test and prints the results to the command line
        - it also runs our tests in the browser of our choice
- So how do I get started making unit tests in Angular?
    - We will need to modify our .spec files to our components and services to properly analyze what behavior we want for our app
