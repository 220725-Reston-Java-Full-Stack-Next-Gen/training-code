> Be sure to take fullscreen shots of your work as you go through this exercise. Any screenshot that doesn't have a timestamp or a visual of your current time will be ignored and points will be deducted.

> Prerequisites: Be sure to have Git installed on your computer before you begin this exercise. No GUIs are allowed for this exercise. Except the text file editing, all interactions will be in the terminal and on the exercise repo page on GitHub. This is an individual exercise; no group colabboration on this exercise.

## Overview
This exercise aims to get more exercise with your local file system and getting used to Git. Please follow all instructions below:

# Section 1 - Cloning the Repo
1. Go to this link [here](https://github.com/aaknox/let-me-git-your-name-exercise).
    a. Be sure to clone the repo to your local computer.
    b. Take a screenshot of your screen after you have cloned the repo. Insert image here.

2. Next, switch yourself from the main branch to the development branch. To do so, run ```git checkout development-branch```.
    a. Take a screenshot here after you are successfully on the development branch. Insert image here.

3. Now create your own branch locally by using the -b option flag in the previous command. Naming conversion for your branch name is ```[your first name]-branch```. If you are unsure how to do this command, be sure to research on Google for the proper syntax.
    a. Take a screenshot here after you are successfully making your branch. Insert image here.

4. Now that you have your own branch, you should be able to modify the greetings text file in the repo. Here, please write one new sentence that greets your fellow batchmates by stating your name and one fun fact about you. You will need to use the following commands:
    - git status
    - git add
    - git commit -m
    - git push
    - git log

5. Take a screenshot of your terminal that shows where you sent your local changes to the remote repository on GitHub. All commands mentioned above must have been used at least once to be approved by trainer.

6. Now go back to your browser and to the exercise repo. On the code tab, next to the dropdown menu of branch names, there should be a number of how many branches are on this repo. Click on that number.
    a. Now, go to All Branches.
    b. On your branch, you should see that you have some changes that you want to send to main branch. Make a new pull request from your branch to the main branch.
    c. Take screenshot of your submitted pull request.

7. Exercise complete! Submit these instructions along with your screenshots on RevPro. Be sure to add today's date. Your submission will be confirmed as completed once your trainer approves your PR.

8. Done!
