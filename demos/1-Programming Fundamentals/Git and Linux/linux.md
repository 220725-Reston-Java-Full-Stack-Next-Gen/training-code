- Terminals vs Shell
    - Terminal is software/hardware that will run a Shell
    - Shell is the software that will receive instructions/commands to interact with the system
- What can I do with a Shell?
    - `sudo`
        - Super User Do
        - "Do something as super user"
        - What is super user?
            - Equivalent to Administrator
            - Often it is called `root`
    - Navigate files
        - `pwd`
        - `cd`
        - `cat`
    - Execute programs
        - Refer to the execeutable by it's location and name to run it
        - `sh`
            - Run a shell inside a shell
            - Create `Shell Scripts`
            - Create a sub-shell and execute all of the instructions inside a file
            - VERY POWERFUL
        - Package Managers
            - Package: Collection of files
            - Manages these "packages"
            - Generally speaking, these "packages" will be executables/programs
            - Install, Delete, configure, manipulate these executables/programs
                - List, purge, search
            - `apt`
            - `apt-get`
            - `yum`
            - `npm`
            - `scoop`
    - Modify directories/files
        - `touch`
        - `mkdir`
        - `mv`
        - `rm`
        - `sed`
        - `cp`
            - Stream Editor
        - Text Editors
            - `vi` or `vim`
            - `nano`
            - `sublime`
                - Must download
        - `chmod`
            - Linux uses "File Mode Bits" to represent permissions in regards to files/folders
            - You can see them with `ls -l`
            - There are 9, which represent read, write, execute permissions for 3 categories
                - user, group, others
            - Each user also gets a group, of which they are the only member of
            - If some software wants to behave as user, it can register a user and a group
                - Instead of being a true user, it is called a `service`
        - `chgrp`: Change Group
        - `chown`: Change Owner
    - Interact with system configuration
        - Environment Variables
        - `env` to print all Environment Variables
        - `echo` with `$` as a prefix to interpolate the value of an Environment variable
    - Manipulate Hardware
    - Check status of the system
        - Resources being used
        - State of different hardware
        - Status of programs
    - Networking
        - `ssh` to connect to other systems
            - Secure Shell
        - `curl` to send network requests
What is the PATH?
- List of folders/directories
- List of folders/directories to search for executable programs that are accessible through a shell
- When you execute a program (generally through a terminal/shell), the system will look through the directories listed in the PATH environment variable (in order), and when it finds the executable with the same, it will run it

What is the difference between a `Thread` and `Process` and a `Service`?
- A Thread is a flow of control of a program
- Processes can consist of multiple Threads
- A service is a Daemon Process, which means it is a process (or multiple processes) that is long-running, and often in the background
- A process is really just a running program
    - Either in the foreground or background
