# Grading Calculator Exercise
> In this exercise, you will be determine the letter grade that the student deserves based on the grade entered by the user

# Instructions:
1. In the main method, do the following:
    a. make an instance of a Scanner so you can get info from the user
    b. prompt the user for a number that will represent the grade
    c. check the number based on these conditions:
        i. 0 - 59 = F
        ii. 60 - 69 = D
        iii. 70 - 79 = C
        iv. 80 - 89 = B
        v. 90 - 100 = A
    d. if any condition is met for that letter, print that letter to the console like this: "The student's grade is: [letter grade]."

You can use any of the conditional statements that we learned in class for this activity. Send a screenshot of your code and your console to trainer via DM on Slack when finished.
