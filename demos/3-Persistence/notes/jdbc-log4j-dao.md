  - This is very important for interviews.  Take a look at [OWASP top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

# DAO Design Pattern
- Explain the `DAO` Design Pattern.  What is it's purpose? Great resource [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/data_access_object_pattern.htm) ðŸ‘ˆ
  - **Data Access Object Interface** - (*i.e `IUserDao.java`*) This interface defines the standard operations to be performed on a model object(s).
  
  - **Data Access Object concrete Class** - (*i.e `UseroDao.java`*) This class implements above interface. This class is responsible to get data from a data source which can be database / xml or any other storage mechanism.
  
  - **Model Object or Value Object** - (*i.e `User.java`*) This object is simple POJO containing get/set methods to store data retrieved using DAO class.
